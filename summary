We created an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Tomcat:

Installed Jenkins on a server to build and deploy code automatically.

Installed Tomcat on another (or same) server to host our application.

Set up user access in Tomcat so Jenkins can deploy there.

Installed Java, which is required to run both Jenkins and Tomcat.

Wrote a Jenkins pipeline that:

Pulls code from GitHub

Builds the code using Maven

Runs tests

Packages the app into a .war file

Deploys that .war to Tomcat using provided credentials

In short: Whenever you push code, Jenkins builds and automatically deploys your app to the Tomcat server.
